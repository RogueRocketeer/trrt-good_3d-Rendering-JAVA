## Getting Started

Very simple to use with the rendering3d.jar which can be run with any .obj file. 

### Usage

1. Clone or download the repo as zip
3. Run the rendering3d.jar with a desired `.obj` file, or with the sample files in `res` 

  for the demo cube: 
   ```
   java -jar rendering3d.jar
   ```
  for a specific model:
   ```
   java -jar rendering3d.jar <model.obj> <scale>
   ```
  for a textured model: 
   ```
   java -jar rendering3d.jar <model.obj> <texture.png> <scale>
   ```
